## Lessons learned ✨

1. Find the **right problem**
  - Don’t build what YOU think is a problem.
  - Build something that the person or company has as a problem.
  - Make sure the problem is big enough. Small problems are not a priority for people and companies.
  - Talk to people. Ask them questions. **DO NOT ASSUME**.
2. Finish ugly
  - **Prototypes** are the lifeblood of early ideas and startups.
  - It’s better to build and show an ugly solution to someone than to have an unfinished, perfect solution that will never see the light of day.
  - Prototypes should be built crudely made, with **very basic system design**, but it should show that it can fix a problem.
3. Ship fast
  - The biggest edge of a startup is that they are **FAST**.
  - The faster you build something, the faster it will get into the hands of a client and the faster they give you feedback.
  - The faster you get feedback, the faster you fail, the faster you correct course, and the faster you get on the right track.
4. Adapt
  - Leave your ego aside.
  - Accept that your idea will not be perfect. Changes and modifications are inevitable.
  - Get feedback from as many people as possible and integrate that feedback.
  - Don't push back on new ideas that **SOLVE THE PROBLEM** for the people you are building a solution.
  - Remember: You are not building the solution FOR YOU. You build it for SOMEONE ELSE.
  - Be prepared to change your idea. Be prepared to start over.
5. **Bounce back when you fail**
  a. Go back to the problem and ask yourself:
    - Is the problem real?
    - Is it important enough?
    - Can we realistically do it with the current constraints?
    - Do we have the right industry?
    - Which other neighbouring industries can we attack?
  b. Test new ideas fast
    - Build a prototype, mockup, or MVP quickly and dirty
    - **Talk to people** or companies about the problems
      - Send messages via email or LinkedIn. Sure, most will not reply, but some will. Be persistent. There is no shame in asking for feedback or help.
    - See if the prototype or MVP you built is the right solution
    - Mark feedback and signals
    - Go back and do it again if it is not the right direction. Prototype -> Talk to people -> Get feedback and signals
  c. Ask for help
    - Ask startups in your community for help
    - Ask organizations for startups and entrepreneurs for help
    - Ask experts for help
    - Send LinkedIn or email messages. Some experts or startups will be busy. Some will respond and take the time to help.
    - Join incubators, accelerators, pitching competitions, and startup events
    - Join startup communities on Discord, Reddit, or LinkedIn
    - Talk to organizations that are designed to help startups and entrepreneurs
